# Using the times method

# We're still struggling to master that levitation charm. Since we need to keep practicing, let's write some code that allows us to puts the phrase "Wingardium Leviosa" only seven times (instead of infinitely, like when we used just a plain loop construct).

# Instructions

# Fork and clone this lab.
# Run the test suite with the learn command.
# You'll be coding your solution in times.rb:
# Fill out the content of the using_times method so that calling it will puts the desired phrase, "Wingardium Leviosa" seven times by using the times keyword.
